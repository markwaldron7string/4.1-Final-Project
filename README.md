Recipe Search App: use the search bar to enter any main ingredient (i.e. pizza, chicken, steak) and find a list of recipes containing that ingredient. Then you can narrow down the results by calories with the slider bar. The calorie slider goes from 0-3000, and it filters recipes containing less than or equal to the number of calories selected. I am proud of the styling on this page, and it was my first time creating a working slider bar.
